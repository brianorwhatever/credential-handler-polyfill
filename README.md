Credential Handler API polyfill

***This polyfill makes use of a UI that emulates secure browser chrome. This polyfill UI is an emulation and IS NOT implemented by the browser. Support for the Credential Handler API could make this UI (or most likely a much better one!) a reality in browsers in the future.***
